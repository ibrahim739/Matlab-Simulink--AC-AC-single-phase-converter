# Matlab-Simulink--Single-Phase-AC-AC-converter
Single-phase AC voltage controller simulation in MATLAB.
An AC voltage controller is a converter that controls the voltage, current and average power delivered to an AC load from an AC source.
The phase-controlled AC voltage controller has several practices uses, including light-dimmer circuits and speed control of induction motor.
A basic single-phase voltage controller is shown with the following parameters:
1.AC source voltage(220V , 50Hz)
2. Resistive load R =10 ohm
3.Inductive load L=0.01H
4. Controlled signaVthy1 and Vthy2
The SCR connection is called anti-parallel or inverse parallel. A Triac is equivalent to the anti-parallel SCRs.
